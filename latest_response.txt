High temperature and humidity (32Â°C, 80%) combined with moderate soil moisture (150) suggest the tomatoes may need watering, but not excessively.  Check the top inch of soil; if dry, water deeply but infrequently to avoid fungal diseases.  Fertilization is likely needed; apply a balanced tomato fertilizer according to package directions. Monitor for pests and diseases common in hot, humid weather.  Ensure good air circulation to prevent fungal growth.
